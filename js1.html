<!-- Problem 1:  Ask the user for their first name.
            Now ask the user for their last name.
            (You will need to use prompt() twice).
            
            Display the response in a popup (alert) as: 
            "Your name is <name>" - filling in their full name. 

            Now ask the user for the number of children they have.
            Display the number of children on the page as a grammatically
            correct sentence ( “You have no children”, “You have 1 child” or
            “You have 2 children”, etc). Note - this should be displayed on the
            page (not in a popup) -->
